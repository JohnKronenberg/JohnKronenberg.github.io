I am [John Kronenberg](mailto:john@testautomate-it.com), since 1997 working in the Testautomation field. 
I worked for some (at least for people living in the Netherlands) well-known consultancy companies (CMG, Bartosz ICT) and I am currently working for [CloseSure](https://www.closesure.nl).

I have worked with a lot of traditional testautomation tools but currently I am mostly working with open source tools, such as Cucumber, jMeter and Robot Framework.

In my career I have presented on the (Dutch) [Testautomation Days](https://www.testautomationdays.com/), [Nederlandse Testdag](https://www.testdag.nl/) and TestNet Voorjaarsevent and TestNet Najaarsevent.

I am part of the editorial team of the Dutch Association of Testers, TestNet. One of my roles in this team is to publish an article quarterly. 
For some years now I write these articles about Testautomation. Because these articles are written in Dutch, my first aim with this blog is to make these articles available in English.
Main reason is because I think these articles are also interesting for non-Dutch speaking testers, test engineers or other in testautomation interested people.

Let's explore with you, readers of this blog, what this blog can be and can become...
